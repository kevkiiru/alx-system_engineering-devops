When you type in google.com, you are presented with a home page screen that has the google logo, a search bar for searching anything on the site, icons to the right of the page for manouvering to other apps and services. 
You also see your country's location to the bottom left of the page. Towards the bottom bar you have other informations on how google works and the services they provide. To the bottom right you have the privacy, terms and settings tabs for easier navigation.
To me that's what i found when typing google.com and pressing enter
